We are excited to announce that Taro has been acquired by EAT Club. Taro was started with the mission of providing healthy, authentic home-cooked food from around the world to busy professionals and families. As we set out to expand our reach and distribution, EAT Club emerged as a natural partner to help us achieve our mission.
</p>

<p>
EAT Club distinguishes itself from other corporate lunch solutions by managing each and every part of the customerâ€™s experience through an integrated platform just like Taro -- starting with the menu selection and ordering platform, food production and on-time delivery into corporate offices, with an emphasis on food quality and workplace satisfaction. We are deeply impressed by the scale, vision and leadership of the EAT Club team, and we are excited to bring our authentic world cuisine to more foodies through their platform.
</p>

<p>
As a part of this partnership, we will be discontinuing our direct-to-consumer meal delivery subscription offering effective immediately as we focus on integrating with the EAT Club team and providing our food and flavors through their corporate platform. For the countless customers who came to depend on us, thank you for allowing us to be a part of your families. We value all the feedback, emails, phone calls and reviews that made our journey worthwhile.
</p>

If you have questions or any support requirement, please email us at <a href="">support@tarobites.com</a>.

<p>
Thanks again, <br/>
and #EatHappy,
</p>

Team Taro
